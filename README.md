# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases my projects, skills, and experiences as a developer. This repository only details personal work, it does not include everything I've done by far, as most of my work is professional work, I won't show it here.

## Projects

### Portfolio Website

This portfolio website is a comprehensive showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer. It is built using modern web technologies and follows best practices for performance, security, and maintainability.

- **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It leverages the latest features of React, including hooks and context API, to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. The styling is managed using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for modular and maintainable CSS.

- **Backend**: The backend is built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It provides RESTful APIs for various functionalities such as user authentication, profile management, and messaging. The backend also integrates with a MySQL database for persistent data storage.

- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time communication is implemented using [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). This allows for instant updates and notifications, such as new messages and profile updates, enhancing the user experience.

- **Authentication**: User authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless authentication. The authentication flow includes features like login, registration, password reset, and token refresh.

- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are managed through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Automated workflows are set up for building and deploying the application to ensure a smooth and reliable development process.

- **Deployment**: The application is hosted on a [DigitalOcean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/) in a Docker container. This setup provides a scalable and isolated environment for running the application, ensuring high availability and performance.

- **API Documentation**: The API for this portfolio is documented using the OpenAPI specification. You can find the API documentation at the following URLs:
  - Local server on port 3000: [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)
  - Local server on port 4000: [http://localhost:4000/api-docs](http://localhost:4000/api-docs)
  - Production server: [https://gfaiers.com/api-docs](https://gfaiers.com/api-docs)

This project demonstrates my ability to build full-stack applications using modern web technologies and best practices. It showcases my skills in frontend and backend development, real-time communication, authentication, CI/CD, and deployment.
